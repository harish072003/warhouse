      <p><strong>Deena Dhayalan</strong> is a passionate and driven fast bowling coach, renowned for his unwavering commitment to nurturing talent and redefining performance training. As the <strong>Founder of WAR HOUSE</strong> and an official partner of <strong>PaceLab</strong>, Deena is at the forefront of a new era in cricket coaching in Tamil Nadu and beyond.</p>

      <p>His journey in cricket spans over nine years as a player, where he represented his college with dedication and grit. Although he never reached the topmost tier of the sport, his deep love for the game and keen observation led him to identify a crucial gap in how fast bowlers were being developed. This realization became the driving force behind his transition into coaching.</p>

      <p>In 2023, after completing his <strong>B.Sc. in Physical Education</strong>, Deena moved to Bangalore, where he immersed himself in calisthenics and strength training. It was during this period that he began coaching emerging bowlers and refining his understanding of performance science.</p>

      <p>A transformative moment in his career came when he travelled to Dubai to meet and learn from <strong>Steffan Jones</strong> — one of the world’s leading fast bowling coaches. Inspired by Steffan’s scientific, biomechanics-based approach, Deena returned to Chennai with a renewed vision for his mission.</p>

      <p>He began implementing a structured training methodology with a select group of young athletes, combining theory, biomechanics, and practical drills. The exceptional results they achieved solidified his belief in the power of elite coaching methods.</p>

      <p>Driven by this success, Deena established <strong>WAR HOUSE</strong> — a high-performance fast bowling academy dedicated to unlocking the true potential of aspiring cricketers. In February 2025, his efforts were recognized globally when WAR HOUSE partnered with <strong>PaceLab</strong> to launch Tamil Nadu’s first elite fast bowling camp.</p>

      <p>Continuing this momentum, the <strong>PaceLab x WAR HOUSE Fast Bowling Camp</strong> will commence on <strong>June 29, 2025</strong>, offering hybrid training to empower bowlers with cutting-edge tools, data-driven insights, and world-class mentorship.</p>

      <p><strong>Deena Dhayalan’s</strong> vision is simple yet powerful: to give fast bowlers the tools, techniques, and mentorship they need to transform their passion into performance — and ultimately, into their future.</p>
